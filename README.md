## Descriptions:
The Model Trainer Exchange uses Hadera blockchain to create smart contracts that allow others to train your model, and receive an award in cryptocurrency. The data is stored off the blockchain, where the location of the data is encrypted and passed through the blockchain. Once a "Trainer" completes a contract, and submits the trained model, they will be rewarded the amount listed on the contract. The user has to connect a cryptocurrency wallet to pay/receive contract awards.

## Architecture:
* Web Application: React JS
* Smart Contracts: Solidity
* Blockchain: Hadera SDK
